# Teaching Assistants' Lab Scheduling System using Logical Programming using Prolog
I implemented a Prolog-based system to assign weekly labs to the available Teaching Assistants (TAs). The system ensured that each lab was assigned exactly one TA, adhered to each TA's specified teaching load, and did not exceed the maximum number of slots a TA could teach per day. The project required the creation of several key predicates, each building upon the others to achieve the final scheduling system.
I began by working on the ta_slot_assignment/3 predicate, which updated the teaching load of a TA after they were assigned a slot. This predicate took a list of TA structures and a TA's name as input, and produced an updated list with the TA's teaching load decremented by one. This step was crucial for ensuring accurate load tracking as TAs were assigned to various slots.
Next, I implemented the slot_assignment/4 predicate, which handled the assignment of TAs to a single lab slot. Given the number of parallel labs in a slot and the list of TAs, this predicate assigned the appropriate number of TAs to the slot and updated their teaching loads accordingly. This function leveraged ta_slot_assignment/3 to manage load updates and ensured that the assignment respected the constraints on teaching loads.
The max_slots_per_day/2 predicate was then developed to verify that no TA was assigned more than the allowed number of labs in a day. This predicate took a day's schedule and a maximum limit as input and checked if the assignment for any TA exceeded the limit. It ensured that the daily assignments were within the specified constraints, maintaining the feasibility of the schedule.
Building on these components, I created the day_schedule/4 predicate to manage the assignments for an entire day. This predicate took the number of parallel labs for each slot in the day, the list of TAs, and produced a list of assignments for each slot, as well as an updated list of TAs with their remaining loads. This function ensured that the assignments respected both the teaching load constraints and the maximum slots per day.
Finally, I integrated all the components in the week_schedule/4 predicate, which generated the complete weekly schedule. This predicate took the weekly lab slots, the list of TAs, and the maximum daily slots as input, and produced a weekly schedule detailing which TAs were assigned to which slots each day. It combined the results from day_schedule/4 for each day of the week, ensuring a consistent and feasible assignment across the entire week.
Through this project, I applied Prolog's logical programming capabilities to solve a complex scheduling problem, ensuring that the final system met all specified constraints and provided a feasible lab schedule for the course's TAs.
